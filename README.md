# Host-a-Wordpress-Website-on-AWS-using-Amazon-Lightsail
In this project, I effectively used Amazon Lightsail, an affordable cloud service, to host a WordPress website on Amazon Web Services (AWS) and linked it with Amazon Route 53 for domain management. This project showcases my proficiency with AWS services, as well as my ability to deploy web applications on AWS.
